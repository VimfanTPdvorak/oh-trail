I wish following information will be useful for users who aren't familiar
with tmux. Here are the very basic thing you must know about:

1. Press Ctrl+s, then press c to launch a new window (shell terminal) in a
   new tab.
2. Press Ctrl+s, then press p to navigate to the previous window
3. Press Ctrl+s, then press n to navigate to the next window

For more trick, press Ctrl+s, then press ? to display tmux's help page.
While on the help page, press q to close the help page.
